Add support for the following command:
    $ clr /path/to/a/directory
    
    => clear only one directory (recursively)

With an option (like --class, for example), remove all .class files if there is a .java file with the same name in the same directory.

make a function:
    clr_file(msg, file_path, $tail|$head):
        test if file exists, display msg, and clear file
